# Python-TensorflowPytorch-Physics-Informed-Neural-Netowork

Physics-Informed-Neural-Network, or the so-called PINN, is a kind of Neural Network universally approximate the PDE outputs solution. 

Though it cannot meet the performance from traditional numerical analysis like Finite Differencing Method (FDM), Finite Element Method (FEM)
But, it has a promising future to make it useful in high-dimensional equation.
